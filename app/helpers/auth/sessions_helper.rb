module Auth
  
  # Contains helpers for establishing and tracking a BACKEND session as well
  # as all authoritzation stuff for both, backend users (staff, admins) and
  # players (characters, authentication provided by identity-provider). 
  #
  # The overal logic is as follows:
  # A) determine whether it's a backend (HTML) or client (JSON) request.
  # B) make sure to authentheldeicate backend requests only with session token 
  #    (cookie), and to authenticate client requests only by bearer
  #    token (provided by identity_provider). 
  # C) given the authenticated backend / client user, authorize requests 
  #    seperately for the request types (client may access different 
  #    resources than backend user and vice versa)
  # D) make sure that 
  #    - it's not possible for clients to get a session token (cookie) with 
  #      the help of bearer token (trade one auth for the other)
  #    - it's not possible to authenticate with both, bearer token and cookie
  #    - it's not possible to access backend-functionality with bearer token 
  #      authentication
  # The implementation distinguishes between client and backend users and has
  # seperate (doubled) methods (current_user/character, authentication & 
  # authorization filters) for both. This complexity unfortunately is 
  # necessary in order to achieve D.
